Skyscanner Front-End Software Engineering virtual experience programme on Forage
- September 2024

 * I built a web application using React as a
   front-end engineer at Skyscanner.
 * Developed a page for picking a travel date using Skyscannerâ€™s open-source
   Backpack React library.
 * Customised my application and ran automated tests to ensure it rendered
   properly.
